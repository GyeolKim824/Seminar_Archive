# Seminar Archive

Hi, I am GYEOL KIM.  
This repository archives my study materials and exercises from two seminar-style learning during my undergraduate studies.

## About
- Machine Learning (Winter 2024)
  Conducted during the winter break of 2024 with my professor and a small group of students.  
  We explored fundamental ML models and implemented them through collaborative self-study.
  - We studied using the publicly available MIT lectures on YouTube.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alfdI7S6wCY&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)
    
- Quantum Key Distribution (Spring 2025)
  Taken as a regular course in the spring semester of 2025.  
  This work focuses on understanding the theoretical foundations and practical aspects of QKD systems.

## Notes
- Some of the notebooks are written in Korean, as my undergraduate program is based in Korea.  
- I know I’m still lacking experience and haven’t done tons of fancy academic work yet, but I tried my best to learn step by step.  
- Please be gentle when you look around :)
