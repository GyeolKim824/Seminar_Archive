# Undergraduate_Archive

Hi, I am GYEOL KIM
- Undergraduate student
- My major is not purely software or hardware, but rather Information and Communication Engineering, which broadly covers both. That means my studies include a mix of soft/hardware and communication systems. (In Undergraduate level, of course :/)
- This repository collects my coursework, exercies and projects
- Since I am Korean and studied in Korean Uni, many of my notes and summaries are written in Korean, so some characters might be broken
- However, there are also materials in Eng, so please fell free to browse

Repository Overview
- I have sorted the coursework into Year 1, 2, and 3.
- Also a few small independent project is included - nothing but my cute littel project :)
